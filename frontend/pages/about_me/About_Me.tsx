            I can say that it was only natural to follow a digital life. Since I
            was a kid that technology was up there in the top of my interests.
            The
            <span className="span2"> Web Developer</span> "bug" got a biger
            spark when I was completing my Multimedia masters, as I heads-on got
            to know programming. Above all, I would describe myself as a
            problem-solving type person, hence the emphasis on a
            <span className="span2"> versatile profile</span>. I value autonomy,
            and once working with others, you'll find I am the first to cheer
            others as I love <span className="span2">teamwork</span>.
