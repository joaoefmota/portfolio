# template-ts-next-express

Super simple TypeScript monorepo with a frontend app using Next and a backend app using Express.

Root of the repo contains the `dev` script and placeholders for potentially useful scripts:
- `dev`: This runs the `dev` scripts in `./frontend` and `./backend` with fancy formatting and in parallel.
- `test`: *Placeholder* for a script to run tests across your packages.
- `build`: *Placeholder* for a script build your packages.
- `start`: *Placeholder* for a script start your built packages.

Once you created your repository from this template make sure to install dependencies with your favorite package manager and you're ready to go! ðŸš€
